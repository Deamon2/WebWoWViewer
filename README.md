# WebWoWViewer
An attempt to recreate old WoWMapViewer application from scratch and entirely in js

Current target is Wrath of the Lich King

##Tech demo
http://deamon87.github.io/WebWoWViewer/index.html

This is early demo. 
After data is downloaded and application is started (blue screen will appear), give it around 30-40 seconds to upload data to GPU. After that it will become less laggy and more responsive.
