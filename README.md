# WebWoWViewer
An attempt to recreate old WoWMapViewer application from scratch and entirely in js

Current target is Wrath of the Lich King

## Tech demo

http://deamon87.github.io/WebWoWViewer/index.html

Early demo. Only first two options are available. All others require a dedicated HTTP server, that will serve unpacked data from client.
Soon I will update that page with a version, where you can use your local WoW directory as source for data
